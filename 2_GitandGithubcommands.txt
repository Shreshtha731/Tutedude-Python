Git >> Version control (to store different Version of the   applications)
    let's say we create an app and have diff. versions of it

    v1
    v2
    v3
new v4(to keep track or fix the bugs)

for 1 st time users{
git config --global user.name "github username"
git config --global user.email "your github email id"
}
git init to create git repo

for connection:
git remote add "origin repo url"

>>It is distributed on cloud
>>It's for collaboration
>>Tracking the other's work
>>Recovery of your versions if you fuck up(which you will)
>> git pull origin {main(branch name)} to pull the files 
>> git status (for checking the status of the app)
>>git add "name of the file"
>>git add . (to add all the files)
>>git commit -m "Commit message"
git push
